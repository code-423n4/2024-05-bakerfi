 * @author Chef Kal-EL <chef.kal-el@bakerfi.xyz>
 *
 * @dev The BakerFi vault deployed to any supported chain (Arbitrum One, Optimism, Ethereum,...)
 *
 * This is smart contract where the users deposit their ETH and receives a share of the pool <x>brETH.
 * A share of the pool is an ERC-20 Token (transferable) and could be used to later to withdraw their
 * owned amount of the pool that could contain (Assets + Yield ). This vault could use a customized IStrategy
 * to deploy the capital and harvest an yield.
 *
 * The Contract is able to charge a performance and withdraw fee that is send to the treasury
 * owned account when the fees are set by the deploy owner.
 *
 * The Vault is Pausable by the the governor and is using the settings contract to retrieve base
 * performance, withdraw fees and other kind of settings.
 *
 * During the beta phase only whitelisted addresses are able to deposit and withdraw
 *
 * The Contract is upgradeable and can use a BakerProxy in front of.
