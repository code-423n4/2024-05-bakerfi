## Vault

_The BakerFi vault deployed to any supported chain (Arbitrum One, Optimism, Ethereum,...)

This is smart contract where the users deposit their ETH and receives a share of the pool <x>brETH.
A share of the pool is an ERC-20 Token (transferable) and could be used to later to withdraw their
owned amount of the pool that could contain (Assets + Yield ). This vault could use a customized IStrategy
to deploy the capital and harvest an yield.

The Contract is able to charge a performance and withdraw fee that is send to the treasury
owned account when the fees are set by the deploy owner.

The Vault is Pausable by the the governor and is using the settings contract to retrieve base
performance, withdraw fees and other kind of settings.

During the beta phase only whitelisted addresses are able to deposit and withdraw

The Contract is upgradeable and can use a BakerProxy in front of._

error ETHTransferNotAllowed(address sender)
```

### onlyWhiteListed

```solidity
modifier onlyWhiteListed()
```

_Modifier to restrict access to addresses that are whitelisted.

This modifier ensures that only addresses listed in the account whitelist
within the contract's settings are allowed to proceed with the function call.
If the caller's address is not whitelisted, the function call will be rejected._

### constructor

```solidity
constructor() public
```

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(address initialOwner, string tokenName, string tokenSymbol, contract ServiceRegistry registry, contract IStrategy strategy) public
```

_Initializes the contract with specified parameters.

This function is designed to be called only once during the contract deployment.
It sets up the initial state of the contract, including ERC20 and ERC20Permit
initializations, ownership transfer, and configuration of the ServiceRegistry
and Strategy._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| initialOwner | address | The address that will be set as the initial owner of the contract. |
| tokenName | string |  |
| tokenSymbol | string |  |
| registry | contract ServiceRegistry | The ServiceRegistry contract to be associated with this contract. |
| strategy | contract IStrategy | The IStrategy contract to be set as the strategy for this contract. Emits an {OwnershipTransferred} event and initializes ERC20 and ERC20Permit features. It also ensures that the initialOwner is a valid address and sets up the ServiceRegistry and Strategy for the contract. |

### rebalance

```solidity
function rebalance() external returns (int256 balanceChange)
```

_Function to rebalance the strategy, prevent a liquidation and pay fees
to protocol by minting shares to the fee receiver

This function is externally callable and is marked as non-reentrant.
It triggers the harvest operation on the strategy, calculates the balance change,
and applies performance fees if applicable._

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| balanceChange | int256 | The change in balance after the rebalance operation. |

### receive

```solidity
receive() external payable
```

_Fallback function to receive Ether.

This function is marked as external and payable. It is automatically called
when Ether is sent to the contract, such as during a regular transfer or as part
of a self-destruct operation.

Only Transfers from the strategy during the withdraw are allowed

Emits no events and allows the contract to accept Ether._

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit(address receiver) external payable returns (uint256 shares)
```

_Deposits Ether into the contract and mints vault's shares for the specified receiver.

This function is externally callable, marked as non-reentrant, and restricted
to whitelisted addresses. It performs various checks, including verifying that
the deposited amount is valid, the Rebase state is initialized, and executes
the strategy's `deploy` function to handle the deposit._

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| receiver | address | The address to receive the minted shares. |
