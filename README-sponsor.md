# Bakerfi Smart Contracts

Recursive ETH Staking made easy, amplify your yields with recursive based strategies based on lending markets (AAVE v3, ...) and flash loans.

## Features

* Pool Based Yield Generation
* Liquidation Protection
* Easy to Use Interface
* Leverage based on Flash Loans
* Liquid Yield Shares matETH 
* Proxied Deployment for Settings, Vault and Strategies

## Integrations 
* AAVE v3 
* Lido Staking Contracts
* Uniswap v3
* Balancer Flash Loans

## Prerequisites
Before getting started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

* Node.js (version 18 or higher)
* NPM (version 9.0 or higher)
* Hardhat (version 2.0.0 or higher)
* Ethereum wallet or provider (e.g., MetaMask)
* Solidity development knowledge


## Installation
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/hvasconcelos/bakerfi
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd bakerfi
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

### Compiling Smart Contracts
To compile the smart contracts, run the following command:

```
npx hardhat compile
```

The compiled artifacts will be placed in the ./artifacts directory.

### Running Tests
To run the automated tests, execute the following command:

```
npm run test

# With Gas Report 
npm run test:gas

# With Gas Report + Test Coverage 
npm run test:coverage
```

This will execute the tests defined in the ./test directory.

## Deployment
To deploy your smart contracts to a specific network, configure the network settings in the hardhat.config.js file. Then, run the deployment script using the following command:

### Production 
```
npx hardhat run --network <network-name> scripts/deploy.ts
```

### Local Development (Ganache)

```
# Open a terminal to run Ganache
npm run ganache:dev 
# Open a separate terminal to run the deployment script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-dev.ts
```

Replace <network-name> with the desired network from your configuration.


## Create an SDK packager 


```
npm run compile:clean && npm run build
```

```
npm pack
```

### Setup Development Environment 

1. Start ganache with the predefined accounts

```
npm run ganache:dev
```

This will start a local Ethereum network with accounts pre-loaded with test Ether. The server will output the available accounts and their private keys.


2. Deploy the Vault Contract with Mocks Deployed

```
npm run deploy:local
```

If everything runs sucessfully you should get Bakerfi Vault deployed with some mocked Services for testing purposes

### Development CLI Commands 

#### Get the Network Deployment Addresses 

```
#HARDHAT_NETWORK=base_devnet npx ts-node --files scripts/cli.ts  contracts <serviceRegistryAddress>
HARDHAT_NETWORK=base_devnet npx ts-node --files scripts/cli.ts  contracts 0xE8A1e868E4736669b73B9E26BE22129bD6B4E83d
```

### Interacting with Contracts
You can interact with the deployed contracts using the Hardhat console. Start the console with the following command:

```
npx hardhat console --network <network-name>
```

Replace <network-name> with the desired network from your configuration.


### Usefull Scripts

**Export Flat File Contracts**
